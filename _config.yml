description: [e-Learning & xAPI Consultant<br>Leveraging technology to streamline workflows & develop engaging learning experiences<br><br>I'm an e-Learning Consultant with 12+ years of experience in learning and development (L&D) and 5+ years in instructional design (ID). I'm currently an L&D and Experience API (xAPI) Consultant, where I've helped international higher education clients seamlessly integrate xAPI solutions into their learning management systems.<br><br>My career has taken me from freelancing to collaborating with dynamic teams at leading organizations like TorranceLearning, where I've worked to master the art of crafting transformative learning experiences.<br><br>With tools like Articulate Storyline, Rise, and Adobe Captivate, I'm able to create immersive courses that captivate and empower learners.<br><br>But it's not just about the technology; it's about the magic that happens when creativity, innovation, and education converge. I've had the privilege of hosting industry events, sharing insights with thought leaders, and continuously pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the e-learning universe.<br>Outside of work, I enjoy media editing and am very interested in learning more about voiceover work. I love learning and passing on information in fun and creative ways, leading me to start a YouTube channel to teach people about xAPI. I'm also in the process of creating a parent advice podcast.<br>If you'd like to connect, please feel free to do so here or via email at lizbarrondev@gmail.com.]
